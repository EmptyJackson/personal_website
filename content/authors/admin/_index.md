I'm a second-year DPhil student at the University of Oxford, where I am co-supervised by Jakob Foerster in {{< staticref "https://foersterlab.com/" "newtab" >}}FLAIR{{< /staticref >}} and Shimon Whiteson in {{< staticref "https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/" "newtab" >}}WhiRL{{< /staticref >}}.

<!-- in the {{< staticref "https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/" "newtab" >}}Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems CDT{{< /staticref >}} -->

I hold an MSc in Machine Learning from University College London, where I worked in the {{< staticref "https://ucldark.com/" "newtab" >}}UCL DARK Lab{{< /staticref >}} on self-supervision in meta-reinforcement learning. Before this, I gained a BA in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, where I worked on real-time video super-resolution.

I've completed software engineering internships at Amazon, Arm and Cubica Technology, working on natural language processing, computer vision and efficient network inference.
